@article{Schwietzke.2014,
 abstract = {The amount of methane emissions released by the natural gas (NG) industry is a critical and uncertain value for various industry and policy decisions, such as for determining the climate implications of using NG over coal. Previous studies have estimated fugitive emissions rates (FER)--the fraction of produced NG (mainly methane and ethane) escaped to the atmosphere--between 1 and 9{\%}. Most of these studies rely on few and outdated measurements, and some may represent only temporal/regional NG industry snapshots. This study estimates NG industry representative FER using global atmospheric methane and ethane measurements over three decades, and literature ranges of (i) tracer gas atmospheric lifetimes, (ii) non-NG source estimates, and (iii) fossil fuel fugitive gas hydrocarbon compositions. The modeling suggests an upper bound global average FER of 5{\%} during 2006-2011, and a most likely FER of 2-4{\%} since 2000, trending downward. These results do not account for highly uncertain natural hydrocarbon seepage, which could lower the FER. Further emissions reductions by the NG industry may be needed to ensure climate benefits over coal during the next few decades.},

@book{Super.2019,
 abstract = {This dataset was prepared by TNO as a contribution to the H2020 project CHE and the H2020 project VERIFY. The basis is a high-resolution ({\~{}}1x1 km) emission inventory providing CO2 and CO (from fossil fuels and biofuels separately) over western Europe (2ºW - 19ºE, 47ºN - 56ºN). The reported emissions by European countries to UNFCCC (CO2) and to EMEP/CEIP (CO) have been used and where needed gap-filled or replaced with emission data from the GAINS model. These country-level emissions are disaggregated in space using a consistent spatial distribution methodology, whereas large point sources are listed with their exact locations. This approach is similar to the one described by~Kuenen et al., (ACP, 2014). Emissions are reported per GNFR sector, with an extra split for road transport.

The emission grids that are part of this dataset are a variation on the base grid, representing the uncertainty in the emission data. Each grid is equally plausible. The grids have been created using a Monte Carlo approach. The uncertainties in the underlying data used to create the base grid (emissions: activity data and emission factors, spatial proxies) have been collected (either from country reports or based on expert judgement). Through the Monte Carlo simulation these uncertainties, taking into account error correlations between some sub-sectors, are combined to create ten new emission grids. The spread in emissions between these emission maps gives an indication of the uncertainty in the emissions.

The grid files (in .csv and .nc format) contain annual total emissions per grid cell for the year 2015. A separate file has been prepared for each ensemble member in the Monte Carlo simulation (indicated with M). The unit in the files is kg/yr.

A detailed description of the Monte Carlo simulation is presented in:

Super, I., Dellaert, S. N. C., Visschedijk, A. J. H., and Denier van der Gon, H. A. C.: Uncertainty analysis of a European high-resolution emission inventory of CO2 and CO to support inverse modelling and network design, Atmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2019-696, in review, 2019.

N.B. It is important to note that 10 maps are not sufficient to describe the sometimes complex uncertainty structures, for example in the case of lognormal uncertainty distributions. The interpretation of the uncertainty based on these 10 maps should therefore be done with care.

NB. Despite efforts to prevent negative emissions to occur in the grid maps, some negative values are still present. In local studies this might cause some issues, and we recommend to set negative emissions to zero in those cases.},

@article{Harrison.2017,
 abstract = {Water-level fluctuations due to reservoir management could substantially affect the timing and magnitude of reservoir methane (CH4) fluxes to the atmosphere. However, effects of such fluctuations on CH4 emissions have received limited attention. Here we examine CH4 emission dynamics in six Pacific Northwest U.S. reservoirs of varying trophic status, morphometry, and management regimes. In these systems, we show that water-level drawdowns can, at least temporarily, greatly increase per-area reservoir CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, and can account for more than 90{\%} of annual reservoir CH4 flux in a period of just a few weeks. Reservoirs with higher epilimnetic [chlorophyll a] experienced larger increases in CH4 emission in response to drawdown (R2 = 0.84, p {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that eutrophication magnifies the effect of drawdown on CH4 emission. We show that drawdowns as small as 0.5 m can stimulate ebullition events. Given that drawdown events of this magnitude are quite common in reservoirs, our results suggest that this process must be considered in sampling strategies designed to characterize total CH4 fluxes from reservoirs. The extent to which (and the mechanisms by which) drawdowns short-circuit connections between methanogenesis and methanotrophy, thereby increasing net CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, should be a focus of future work.},

@article{Li.2020,
 abstract = {Doppler wind lidar has played an important role in alerting low-level wind shear (LLW). However, these high-resolution observations are underused in the model-based analysis and forecasting of LLW. In this regard, we employed the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and its three-dimensional variational (3D-VAR) system to investigate the impact of lidar data assimilation (DA) on LLW simulations. Eight experiments (including six assimilation experiments) were designed for an LLW process as reported by pilots, in which different assimilation intervals, assimilation timespans, and model vertical resolutions were examined. Verified against observations from Doppler wind lidar and an automated weather observing system (AWOS), the introduction of lidar data is helpful for describing the LLW event, which can represent the temporal and spatial features of LLW, whereas experiments without lidar DA have no ability to capture LLW. While lidar DA has an obviously positive role in simulating LLW in the 10--20 min after the assimilation time, this advantage cannot be maintained over a longer time. Therefore, a smaller assimilation interval is favorable for improving the simulated effect of LLW. In addition, increasing the vertical resolution does not evidently improve the experimental results, either with or without assimilation.},

@article{Sieczko.2020,
 abstract = {Lakes are considered the second largest natural source of atmospheric methane (CH4). However, current estimates are still uncertain and do not account for diel variability of CH4 emissions. In this study, we performed high-resolution measurements of CH4 flux from several lakes, using an automated and sensor-based flux measurement approach (in total 4,580 measurements), and demonstrated a clear and consistent diel lake CH4 flux pattern during stratification and mixing periods. The maximum of CH4 flux were always noted between 10:00 and 16:00, whereas lower CH4 fluxes typically occurred during the nighttime (00:00-04:00). Regardless of the lake, CH4 emissions were on an average 2.4 higher during the day compared to the nighttime. Fluxes were higher during daytime on nearly 80{\%} of the days. Accordingly, estimates and extrapolations based on daytime measurements only most likely result in overestimated fluxes, and consideration of diel variability is critical to properly assess the total lake CH4 flux, representing a key component of the global CH4 budget. Hence, based on a combination of our data and additional literature information considering diel variability across latitudes, we discuss ways to derive a diel variability correction factor for previous measurements made during daytime only.},

For source type attribution, an isotope ratio mass spectrometer was deployed in the city. The urban district hosts an extensive industrial and port area in the south as well as a large conglomerate of residential areas north of the Elbe River. For emission modeling, the TNO GHGco (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research greenhouse gas and co-emitted species emission database) inventory was used as a prior for the inversion. In order to improve the inventory, two approaches were followed: (1) the addition of a large natural CH{\textless}span class={\textquotedbl}inline-formula{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} source, the Elbe River, which was previously not included in the inventory, and (2) mobile measurements were carried out to update the spatial distribution of emissions in the TNO GHGco gridded inventory and derive two updated versions of the inventory.The addition of the river emissions improved model performance, whereas the correction of the spatial distribution with mobile measurements did not have a significant effect on the total emission estimates for the campaign period. A comparison of the updated inventories with emission estimates from a Gaussian plume model (GPM) showed that the updated versions of the inventory match the GPM emissions estimates well in several cases, revealing the potential of mobile measurements to update the spatial distribution of emission inventories. The mobile measurement survey also revealed a large and, at the time of the study, unknown point source of thermogenic origin with a magnitude of 7.9 {\textless}span class={\textquotedbl}inline-formula{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}$\pm${\textless}/span{\textgreater} 5.3 kg h{\textless}span class={\textquotedbl}inline-formula{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}$-$1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} located in a refinery.The isotopic measurements show strong indications that there is a large biogenic CH{\textless}span class={\textquotedbl}inline-formula{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} source in Hamburg that produced repeated enhancements of over 1 ppm which correlated with the rising tide of the river estuary.The CH{\textless}span class={\textquotedbl}inline-formula{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} emissions (anthropogenic and natural) of the city of Hamburg were quantified as 1600 {\textless}span class={\textquotedbl}inline-formula{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}$\pm${\textless}/span{\textgreater} 920 kg h{\textless}span class={\textquotedbl}inline-formula{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}$-$1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, 900 {\textless}span class={\textquotedbl}inline-formula{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}$\pm${\textless}/span{\textgreater} 510 kg h{\textless}span class={\textquotedbl}inline-formula{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}$-$1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} of which is of anthropogenic origin.This study reveals that mobile street-level measurements may miss the majority of total methane emissions, potentially due to sources located within buildings, including stoves and boilers operating on natural gas.

@article{Liu.2019,
 abstract = {The genetic identification of different types of natural gas is notably important for assessment of its sources and exploration potential. The chemical and isotopic (C and H, in particular) compositions of natural gas vary significantly due to the complexity of its generation, migration, and accumulation processes. The ``coal-type'' gas generated from humic matter is generally enriched in 13C as compared to {\textquotedbl}oil-type{\textquotedbl} gas generated from sapropelic organic matter. However, gas originating from fresh-brackish water environments is depleted in 13C whereas gas from saline environments is enriched in 13C. Notwithstanding organic precusors and sedimentary environments, both isotope compositions of alkanes tend to become enriched both in 13C and 2H with prograde thermal evolution. Therefore, in addition to thermal maturity, source material is the major controlling factor of carbon isotope compositions, whereas sedimentary environment is predominant in governing hydrogen isotopes. Secondary processes, including thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) and diffusion, result in an enrichment of the gases in 13C and 2H due to mass-dependent kinetic isotope effect. Microbial degradation causes a decrease in propane content and an enrichment in 12C and 2H of the residual propane. The abiogenic gases may include methane from deep mantle and high molecular weight hydrocarbons through Fischer-Tropsch type (FTT) synthesis. Methane of mantle origin possesses a narrow range of isotope compositions, although it is still a tall task to determine the exact values. In contrast, isotopes of alkane gases synthesized from FTT processes are in a wide range. In sedimentary basins, the mixing of gases from multiple sources and/or through different secondary processes may pose a challenage to identification of their origins. The detailed assessment is provided here with case studies from major oil and gas basins in China. This review provides identification of misconceptions in genetic types of natural gas using carbon and hydrogen isotopes of alkanes, and sheds insights into using isotope geochemistry as an important diagnostic tool for energy exploration as well.},

@article{Singh.2000,
 abstract = {In view of its impact on the earth's climate, methane despite its low atmospheric concentration, has assumed importance in recent years. Natural wetlands are one of the major sources for methane emission to the atmosphere. This study was carried out to find out the seasonal fluctuation in CH4 fluxes from water bodies and the difference in the methane efflux from vegetated and unvegetated surfaces of natural and man-made water bodies as well as to investigate the edaphic factors controlling the methane production and emission. The results revealed that there were seasonal fluctuations in methane emission from both the natural and man-made water bodies. Evidently, CH4 emission from the vegetated surface was many times higher than that from the unvegetated surface of the same water body, indicating the importance of vegetation in methane transport from sediments to atmosphere. Study of several edaphic factors like pH, redox potential, temperature and organic carbon of 10 water bodies, including 5 man-made ponds showed that all these factors largely determined CH4 production in the sediment as reflected by its emission from water bodies.},

These emissions comprise sporadic releases of large amounts of methane during maintenance operations or equipment failures not accounted for in current inventory estimates. We collected and analyzed hundreds of very large releases from atmospheric methane images sampled by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) between 2019 and 2020. Ultra-emitters are primarily detected over the largest O{\&}G basins throughout the world. With a total contribution equivalent to 8 to 12{\%} ({\~{}}8 million metric tons of methane per year) of the global O{\&}G production methane emissions, mitigation of ultra-emitters is largely achievable at low costs and would lead to robust net benefits in billions of US dollars for the six major O{\&}G-producing countries when considering societal costs of methane.},

We report natural gas emission rates for 1 y in the urban region of Boston, using a comprehensive atmospheric measurement and modeling framework. Continuous methane observations from four stations are combined with a high-resolution transport model to quantify the regional average emission flux, 18.5 $\pm$ 3.7 (95{\%} confidence interval) g CH4 $\cdot$ m(-2) $\cdot$ y(-1). Simultaneous observations of atmospheric ethane, compared with the ethane-to-methane ratio in the pipeline gas delivered to the region, demonstrate that natural gas accounted for $\sim$ 60-100{\%} of methane emissions, depending on season. Using government statistics and geospatial data on natural gas use, we find the average fractional loss rate to the atmosphere from all downstream components of the natural gas system, including transmission, distribution, and end use, was 2.7 $\pm$ 0.6{\%} in the Boston urban region, with little seasonal variability. This fraction is notably higher than the 1.1{\%} implied by the most closely comparable emission inventory.},

A correlation observed for all samples between C13 isotope abundance and concentration in air can be explained by assuming an initial composition for atmospheric carbon dioxide of 0.031 volume per cent in air, C13C12 ratio$-$7.0 per mil., to which is added carbon dioxide of plant origin with a ratio of approximately $-$23 per mil. Minimum concentrations and associated carbon isotope ratios at different stations show very little variation (0.0307--0.0316 per cent, $-$6.7 to $-$7.4 per mil) and are believed to be representative of Pacific maritime air. Oxygen isotope abundances are approximately the same as for carbon dioxide in chemical equilibrium with average ocean water, but individual samples show variations which generally do not correlate with changes in concentration in air and are as yet unexplained.},

The LiDARs were carefully engineered to perform user-defined and time-controlled scanning trajectories. Their wireless coordination via the master computer allows achieving and maintaining the LiDARs' synchronization within ten milliseconds. The long-range WindScanner system measures the wind field by emitting and directing three laser beams to intersect, and then scanning the beam intersection over a region of interest.

@article{Lebel.2022,
 abstract = {Natural gas stoves in {\textgreater}40 million U.S. residences release methane (CH4)─a potent greenhouse gas─through post-meter leaks and incomplete combustion. We quantified methane released in 53 homes during all phases of stove use: steady-state-off (appliance not in use), steady-state-on (during combustion), and transitory periods of ignition and extinguishment. We estimated that natural gas stoves emit 0.8-1.3{\%} of the gas they use as unburned methane and that total U.S. stove emissions are 28.1 [95{\%} confidence interval: 18.5, 41.2] Gg CH4 year-1. More than three-quarters of methane emissions we measured originated during steady-state-off. Using a 20-year timeframe for methane, annual methane emissions from all gas stoves in U.S. homes have a climate impact comparable to the annual carbon dioxide emissions of 500 000 cars. In addition to methane emissions, co-emitted health-damaging air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into home air and can trigger respiratory diseases. In 32 homes, we measured NOx (NO and NO2) emissions and found them to be linearly related to the amount of natural gas burned (r2 = 0.76; p $\ll$ 0.01). Emissions averaged 21.7 [20.5, 22.9] ng NOx J-1, comprised of 7.8 [7.1, 8.4] ng NO2 J-1 and 14.0 [12.8, 15.1] ng NO J-1. Our data suggest that families who don't use their range hoods or who have poor ventilation can surpass the 1-h national standard of NO2 (100 ppb) within a few minutes of stove usage, particularly in smaller kitchens.},

Incubation experiments with disturbed soil material showed two optima of methane production at 10°C and in the mesophilic temperature range.

 abstract = {Different CH4 sources have distinct \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 signatures over large spatial scales. Atmospheric \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 data and source signatures together can provide strong additional constraints for better allocation of different CH4 sources. Before the large dataset of \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 source signatures was available from Schwietzke et al. (2016), the source signatures used in previous global CH4 budget studies were either based on limited studies or were not representative of global means. Sherwood et al. (2017) further updated the \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 signature dataset over Schwietzke et al. (2016). Here we continue the effort to update this database using recent peer-reviewed literature and conference and government reports. The new database (2020 version) includes measurements from 9477 measurements from fossil fuels (FF) which are representative of FF emissions from 47 countries accounting for {\~{}}81{\%} of global oil and natural gas (ONG) and {\~{}}90{\%} of global coal production, and 1776 measurements from microbial and 935 measurements from biomass burning sources.

In addition to the large database of \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 signatures, we also compile gridded global maps of \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 source signatures for all major emission sources to be used in atmospheric modeling. The gridded maps represent the globally spatial gradients in \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 signatures depending on data availability. Details regarding the methods used are documented in Lan et al. (2021) (see following citation). These emission sources with spatially-resolved source signatures are ONG, coal, biomass and biofuel burning, ruminants and wild animals. For natural geological seep emissions, spatially-resolved \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 signatures are available from Etiope et al. (2019). For wetland emissions, spatially-resolved \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 signatures are available from Ganesan et al., (2018). For other CH4 sources, the current measurement sample sizes are insufficient to develop spatial distributions, which includes emissions from waste/landfills, termites, and rice. Globally averaged \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 source signatures can be used in modeling studies in this case (see Lan et al. (2021) for details). Atmospheric \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 data used in Lan et al.

 abstract = {Significant climate risks are associated with a positive carbon-temperature feedback in northern latitude carbon-rich ecosystems, making an accurate analysis of human impacts on the net greenhouse gas balance of wetlands a priority. Here, we provide a coherent assessment of the climate footprint of a network of wetland sites based on simultaneous and quasi-continuous ecosystem observations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Experimental areas are located both in natural and in managed wetlands and cover a wide range of climatic regions, ecosystem types, and management practices. Based on direct observations we predict that sustained CH4 emissions in natural ecosystems are in the long term (i.e., several centuries) typically offset by CO2 uptake, although with large spatiotemporal variability. Using a space-for-time analogy across ecological and climatic gradients, we represent the chronosequence from natural to managed conditions to quantify the {\textquotedbl}cost{\textquotedbl} of CH4 emissions for the benefit of net carbon sequestration. With a sustained pulse-response radiative forcing model, we found a significant increase in atmospheric forcing due to land management, in particular for wetland converted to cropland. Our results quantify the role of human activities on the climate footprint of northern wetlands and call for development of active mitigation strategies for managed wetlands and new guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) accounting for both sustained CH4 emissions and cumulative CO2 exchange.},

@article{Sargent.2021,
 abstract = {Across many cities, estimates of methane emissions from natural gas (NG) distribution and end use based on atmospheric measurements have generally been more than double bottom-up estimates. We present a top-down study of NG methane emissions from the Boston urban region spanning 8 y (2012 to 2020) to assess total emissions, their seasonality, and trends. We used methane and ethane observations from five sites in and around Boston, combined with a high-resolution transport model, to calculate methane emissions of 76 $\pm$ 18 Gg/yr, with 49 $\pm$ 9 Gg/yr attributed to NG losses. We found no significant trend in the NG loss rate over 8 y, despite efforts from the city and state to increase the rate of repairing NG pipeline leaks. We estimate that 2.5 $\pm$ 0.5{\%} of the gas entering the urban region is lost, approximately three times higher than bottom-up estimates. We saw a strong correlation between top-down NG emissions and NG consumed on a seasonal basis. This suggests that consumption-driven losses, such as in transmission or end-use, may be a large component of emissions that is missing from inventories, and require future policy action. We also compared top-down NG emission estimates from six US cities, all of which indicate significant missing sources in bottom-up inventories. Across these cities, we estimate NG losses from distribution and end use amount to 20 to 36{\%} of all losses from the US NG supply chain, with a total loss rate of 3.3 to 4.7{\%} of NG from well pad to urban consumer, notably larger than the current Environmental Protection Agency estimate of 1.4{\%} [R. A. Alvarez et al., Science 361, 186-188 (2018)].},

@article{Harrison.2017b,
 abstract = {Water-level fluctuations due to reservoir management could substantially affect the timing and magnitude of reservoir methane (CH4) fluxes to the atmosphere. However, effects of such fluctuations on CH4 emissions have received limited attention. Here we examine CH4 emission dynamics in six Pacific Northwest U.S. reservoirs of varying trophic status, morphometry, and management regimes. In these systems, we show that water-level drawdowns can, at least temporarily, greatly increase per-area reservoir CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, and can account for more than 90{\%} of annual reservoir CH4 flux in a period of just a few weeks. Reservoirs with higher epilimnetic [chlorophyll a] experienced larger increases in CH4 emission in response to drawdown (R2 = 0.84, p {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that eutrophication magnifies the effect of drawdown on CH4 emission. We show that drawdowns as small as 0.5 m can stimulate ebullition events. Given that drawdown events of this magnitude are quite common in reservoirs, our results suggest that this process must be considered in sampling strategies designed to characterize total CH4 fluxes from reservoirs. The extent to which (and the mechanisms by which) drawdowns short-circuit connections between methanogenesis and methanotrophy, thereby increasing net CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere, should be a focus of future work.},

 abstract = {A thorough understanding of methane sources is necessary to accomplish methane reduction targets. Urban environments, where a large variety of methane sources coexist, are one of the most complex areas to investigate. Methane sources are characterised by specific \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 signatures, so high precision stable isotope analysis of atmospheric methane can be used to give a better understanding of urban sources and their partition in a source mix. Diurnal measurements of methane and carbon dioxide mole fraction, and isotopic values at King's College London, enabled assessment of the isotopic signal of the source mix in central London. Surveys with a mobile measurement system in the London region were also carried out for detection of methane plumes at near ground level, in order to evaluate the spatial allocation of sources suggested by the inventories. The measured isotopic signal in central London (-45.7 $\pm$0.5‰) was more than 2‰ higher than the isotopic value calculated using emission inventories and updated \textgreek{d}13C-CH4 signatures. Besides, during the mobile surveys, many gas leaks were identified that are not included in the inventories. This suggests that a revision of the source distribution given by the emission inventories is needed.},

@article{Wu.2007,
 abstract = {River and sediment have unique carbon dynamics and are important sources of the dominant greenhouse gases (GHG), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). To understand the relationship between CO2/CH4 emissions and water quality/sediment characteristics, we have investigated critical parameters in the river water. Eight parameters of water quality (dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential [ORP], chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand [BOD5], suspended solid, nitrate [NO3-], NH4+, and bacteria) and four sediment characteristics (total organic carbon [TOC], total nitrogen [T-N], NO3-, and ammonium [NH4+]) were measured in two of the larger rivers in Taiwan, and relevant environmental conditions were recorded. The experimental results indicated that CO2 emissions from the river were mainly affected by BOD5 concentrations and the levels of bacteria. CH4 emissions, on the other hand, were greatly affected by the ORP in the river. The correlation between CO2 emissions and sediment characteristics was insignificant (R2 {\textless} 0.3). However, TOC and T-N in the sediment may lead to increases in CH4 emissions into the atmosphere. A deeper analysis of the relationship between the different parameters and GHG emissions by ANOVA and the multiple regression method revealed that CO2 emission (y) was significantly related to bacteria number (x1) and BOD concentration (X2). The regression equation takes the form y = 0.00032x1 + 3.18089x2 + 25.37304. Also, the regression relationship between CH4 emission (y) and ORP (x) in the river can be described as y = -0.825216x + 169.02257. The relationship between CH4 emission and sediment characteristics may be described as y = 5.073962x1(TOC) + 2.871245x2(T-N) - 12.3262. Extra sampling data were collected to examine the feasibility of the developed multiple regression equations. The experimental results suggest that the emissions of such GHGs as CO2 and CH4 from rivers can be predicted using the regression equations developed here. Moreover, the emissions may be reduced by manipulating the proper factors.},
