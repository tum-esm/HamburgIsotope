The codebase is in written R.
The Scripts are located in the folder:
/GitHub/Hamburg_Methane_Peaks/4_Scrips_and_Data/3_Scripts
To execute the scripts, use RStudio
The script /Hamburg_Methane_Peaks/4_Scrips_and_Data/3_Scripts/Master_Script.R can execute the most relevant scripts altogether.
WARNING this takes a long time.
Execution of individual scripts or functions in the script /Hamburg_Methane_Peaks/4_Scrips_and_Data/3_Scripts/Plotting_With_Compleate_CSV_File_Data.R is much more efficient.
